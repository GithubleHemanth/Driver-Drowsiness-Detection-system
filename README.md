Created a real-time driver drowsiness detection system leveraging computer vision and deep
learning.
Applied OpenCV for facial landmark detection and Keras for training a Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN).
Achieved an accuracy of 94 percent in detecting signs of driver drowsiness, contributing to
enhanced road safety.
Integrated alert mechanisms for timely driver intervention, such as alarms or notifications
